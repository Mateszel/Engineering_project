My biggest project yet. It includes simulation and visualization of
Rings of the Saturn in real-time using graphics card. The image is updated 
About 30 times per second, which creates a smooth animation. 
There are almost 1 million particles that make up the rings.
Simulation is based on gravitational forces.
